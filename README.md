# TriggerTracker Native

TriggerTracker is an App that a person can use to track what they're eating and how it relates to negative reactions they might have so that they might figure out trigger foods for migraines, upset stomachs, allergies, hangovers, and other symptoms through data.

This repository is for the native app portion where the UI is coded. This is many experiments: using Flow, React Native, Create React Native App, and probably more that I haven't realized yet.  More to come.
